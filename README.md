# Fourier Series Hi

A short Jupyter notebook dedicated to the display and use of a Fourier Series to output a word. Note that there's a distinct lack of resolution that I'm using for computational power, and so the end result looks more like a step function. This is due to the Gibbs offshoots on the spikes not being super easy to render. 5,000 iterations of 100,000 points is not a small task.
